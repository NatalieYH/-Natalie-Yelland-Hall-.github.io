    <h1>About me</h1>
<img src="Me.jpg" alt="Me" style="width:300px;height:300px;">
    <p>I am 25 year old currently studying IT at RMIT university. I love reading and video games and relaxing with all my pets. I live in country <br>
 victoria on a farm with my boyfriend and his family. I grew up in north melbourne with my family and spent a lot of time practicing sports like karate <br>
 and gymnastics.</p>


<h1> Education </h1>
<p> I finished high school at 17 and began a degree in biological sciences, unfortunately, due to a issue with my legs and my diabetes I was rendered <br>
 unable to complete this study in the 3rd year due to being wheelchair bound. Since then I have been going to may different medical appionentments and trying <br>
 to find something new to do. I chose IT as it is a subject that has always interested me, I have many memories of putting together PC's out of spare and<br>
 hand me down parts and playing games with friends. I am hopeful that I will be able to find something within IT that interests me and that I can <br> 
 make a career out of. Being able to study online at RMIT made it a lot easier as living so far from a town and being unable to drive, i had no way to get <br> 
 to any classes.  </p>


<h1> Briggs-Myers Test</h1>
<img src="Briggs.jpg" alt="Briggs-myers test result" style="width:650px;height:600px;">
<p> As a defender type personality, teamwork should not be an issue for me, as I prefer to help others and let them take the lead. However, having suck a low <br> 
intraversion score means I struggle to speak to others and will often let my ideas slip by the group as I dont wish to speak up. Other traits of a defender incule <br>
 being meticulous, analitical and hard working, all useful in the job force.  I </p>

<h1> Learning Styles Test</h1>
<img src="Learning.jpg" alt="Learning styles test result" style="width:500px;height:200px;">
<p> As a visual learner, I learn and work best by being able to read and look at what i am working on at the time. I like to use charts and books and written <br> 
instructions in order to work most effectively. In IT this will be useful as a lot of work involves looking at a screen and working off what you can see, rather than <br>
 vocal or physical interactions  </p>
<h1> Big 5 Test</h1>
<img src="Big5.jpg" alt="Big 5 test result" style="width:500px;height:500px;">
<p> Again, my big 5 personality test highlighted the fact that I am rather introverted and agreeable. In a team this is still rather useful as I tend to follow the <br>
 leader and get work done when requested. </p>
